                CORE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
            </h2>

            I am responsible person with professional attitude to work.
            <p/>
            Years of experience in different fields of business activity gave me a great foundation of knowledge and
            active thinking.
            <p/>
            Back office experience in corporate governance matters taught me to be precise and mindful.
            Studying in the multicultural environment helped me to develop the perception of diverse cultures and
            behaviors and sociability.
            The increased need for professionals in IT specialties prompted me to master the specialty of front-end
            developer.
            I enjoy working with others but equally able to work on my own.
